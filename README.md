# Bike Buyers Excel Project
This is a personal project to showcase my proficiency in Microsoft Excel.

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and **I've utilized some Excel functionalities in cleaning the data** such as:
- **removing duplicates**
- **replacing texts**
- reformatting currency values
- creating age brackets using **nested IF formulas**

I've also set up some **pivot tables** to initialize the dashboard.
- Pivot Table 1 shows the average income of bike buyers by gender.
- Pivot Table 2 shows their commute distance.
- And Pivot Table 3 shows the comparison of their buying decisions by age bracket.

The final section of the project is the **Bike Sales Dashboard** where I combined all the charts created from the pivot tables.
Along with these charts are the **slicers** to have various options in viewing the charts.
